# Behavioral-Data-Analysis

With a background in Behavior Analysis, Psychology, and Data Science, I am hoping to use this space to explore data-driven approachs to behavioral topics. Buisson (2021) mentions unqiue obstacles facing data scientists in the realm of behavioral data analysis, in a tone overlapping with prominent Behavioral Scientists. Most notably, they argue that behavior, especially human behavior, is complex in understanding cause and outcomes. What causes change in human behavior can be nuanced, unpredictable, and from a data perspective non-existent. That being said, behavior is at all times prominent event, occurring around us at all times, and with unique imprints/ impacts on the environment. These traces and outcomes form behavior can be hard to ignore, from a scientific perspecitve, at understanding change driving agent. Skinner (1965) had led the discussion of determining and examining causes for behavior. In his view, behavior is an event which causes can be described, predicted, and eventually controlled through a scientific approach. He also, notably, argued that causes of behavior can be found in the immediate environment, including antecedent and consequent variables surrounding behavioral events. This was an argument he placed against traditional psychological approaches to understanding behavior, that is, as a result of a "mental process", or often immesurable processes. While intruiging, this information is likely of little use to a data scientist/ analyst who is limited to a data table, alone, to determine trends, causes, and correlates of behavior....
