# Behavioral-Data-Analysis
I am hoping to use this respository to experiment with concepts in behavioral science and data analytics, paying specific attention to predictive analysis, causal analysis, concepts of construct validity and measurement as it applies to behavior. One dataset I am starting with, accessible [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/468/online+shoppers+purchasing+intention+dataset). Previous analyses on this dataset aimed to predict some abstract elements of human behavior, for example, 'intention', which I think is an important concept in behavioral data analysis. Buisson (2021) noted the complexities when it comes to determining causes of human behavior given a dataset,. They define some of the conceptual and definitional errors that can impact useful analysis and measurement of behavior given a dataset. One of the key barriers they noted in these types of analyses, is that behavior, itself, is rarely defined in an approriate way. In other words, definitions for behavior often lack construct validity, or assume functions and causes of behavior that are often immesurable, or assumed, rather than detected.

This concept is not unfamiliar to behavioral science, and the field of psychology, in general, where an ongoing debate into the operational defining of behavior continues. Skinner (1965) was a notable firgure in this debate, who, at the time, contested traditional psychological frameworks for causal analysis of human behavior. He had argued against abstract, and immeasurable constructs of behavior that rely on unobservable events. In other words, events from within, terms like intention, motivation, and thinking, are often abstract constructs that we can directly see. We can infer that these factors may play a role, but the methods for measuring these events can vary greatly between analysts, leaving the reliability of these approaches in question. Skinner had argued for a more empirical approach to human behavior, and determining causes for human behavior. During his time, he limited a unit of analysis to the observable behavior and it's immediate environment, arguing that factors in these momements were usually sufficient for expplaining causes of behavior. 

The question is, how does that help a data analyst, who is limited to specific data types/ dimensions. Buisson (2021) had argued, similarly, on the construct failures of data analysts to accurately define behavior. He had also urged caution in assuming causes, and mehcanisms for behavior, within a dataset. Often times, what could be observed as correlation between variables, doesn't imply causation, and in the case of behavior finding causation, especially withouth direct observation and data collection, is a daunting task. Instead, he aimed to reduce the efforts to including key elements in behavioral data analysis. Not to assume confidence in causal analysis, but to provide some useful factors that can help researchers get to that point. To demonstrate a true cause for behavior really is a rigorous process, and cause as it pertains to behavior can be as conceptually ambiguous as defining behavior itself. 

I'll use these guidelines to approach this dataset, and see if it changes the approach in any meaningful ways.
