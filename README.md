# Behavioral-Data-Analysis

The goal here is to find some useful approaches when handling behavior or behavior related data. Behavior as a variable in data analysis is as complex as it is useful. As such, I am hoping to use this project to address some of the theoretical and techinal dilemmas common when handling behavioral data. One of the key dilemmas of behavioral data, not entirely foreign to any data, is it's multi-facetedness. Behavior can be the result of compound variables, both internal and external, making it difficut, at times, to rely fully on the values presented within a data table. Not all variables relevant to the prediction and analysis of behavior are measurable, or yet measureable, and the availability of say... neurological, external, and behavioral data in conjunction can be limited. Having this complexity doesn't render the available data, however to be entirely useless. I'm hoping to use this project to highlight some ways we can make use of available data, highlighting some principles of behavior in effect, adn seeing if that can help guide the analytical process of myself and hopefully others.
