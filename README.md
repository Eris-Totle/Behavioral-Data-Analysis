# Behavioral-Data-Analysis
IN PROGRESS: I am hoping to use this respository to experiment with concepts in behavioral science and data analytics, paying specific attention to predictive analysis, causal analysis, concepts of construct validity and measurement as it applies to behavior. One dataset I am starting with, accessible [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/468/online+shoppers+purchasing+intention+dataset). Previous analyses on this dataset aimed to predict some abstract elements of human behavior, for example, 'intention', which I think is an important concept in behavioral data analysis (Sakar, Polat, Katircioglu, & Kastro, 2019). Buisson (2021) noted the complexities when it comes to determining causes of human behavior given a dataset. Specifically, they highlight the conceptual/ definitional errors that can impact useful measurement and analysisof behavior given a dataset. One of the key barriers they noted in these types of analyses, is that behavior is rarely defined in an approriate way. In other words, definitions for behavior often lack construct validity, or assume functions and causes of behavior that are often immesurable, or assumed, rather than detected. For example......

This concept is not unfamiliar to behavioral science, where an ongoing debate into operational defining behavior continues to pose challenges. Skinner (1965) was a notable firgure in this debate, who, at the time, contested traditional psychological frameworks for causal analysis of human behavior. He had argued against abstract, and immeasurable constructs of behavior that rely on unobservable events. In other words, events from within, terms like intention, motivation, and thinking, are often abstract constructs that we cannot directly see. We can assume that these factors may play a role, but the methods for measuring these events can vary greatly between analysts, leaving the reliability of these approaches in question. 

Even within psychological research, the development accurate assessments for internal states like intention, is a work in progress (). Considering some methods psychological research uses to evaluate internal states, considering their stregnths and weaknesses, can be useful in guiding a data analyst about approaching the same topics. Further, it can help guide the language of a data analyst to refine their conclusions stricly to elements within the data, or even to practice caution about inferring events from an analysis. 

It could alternatively be argued that intention is never directly measured Sakar, Polat, Katircioglu, and Kastro (2019) analysis. Rather, it was the "probability" that someone will purchase an item that was measured. Defining it in terms of probability keeps the definition to what is observeable, while avoiding the assumption of an inner state. Skinner had argued for a more empirical approach to human behavior, and determining causes for human behavior. During his time, he limited a unit of analysis to the observable behavior and it's immediate environment, arguing that factors in these momements were usually sufficient for explaining causes of behavior. 

The question is, how does that information help a data analyst who is limited to specific data types/ dimensions? Buisson (2021) had argued, similarly, on the construct failures of data analysts to accurately define behavior. He had also urged caution in assuming causes, and mehcanisms for behavior, within a dataset. Often times, what could be observed as correlation between variables, doesn't imply causation. In the case of behavior, finding causation without direct observation and data collection can be a daunting task. Instead, he aimed to reduce the efforts to including key elements in behavioral data analysis. Not to assume confidence in causal analysis, but to provide some useful factors that can help researchers get to that point. To demonstrate a true cause for behavior really is a rigorous process, and cause as it pertains to behavior can be as conceptually ambiguous as defining behavior itself. 

I'll use these guidelines to approach this dataset, and see if it changes the approach in any meaningful ways. Before going into that, I think it's relevant to review 1) why behavior (however it is defined) is a scientifically valid event deserving attention 2) challenges in defining behavior and it's causes 3) determining how these insights can impact data science/ analytic decision making around behavioral data (i.e. preprocessing data, selected relevant factors, aggregating variables, analysis, and most importantly, phrasing the conclusions about what we're saying about the true event/ workings of behavior).
